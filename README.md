Raw vector file and different file formats of logo, and social media assets for Civic Tech brand stuff.
Open to anyone who wants to play with the design and such.

The concept of the logo is an open dialogue/work-in-progress for a diverse and inclusive community.
The logo is a type-face based design, with the caret at the end of it as if it is still being typed out on a computer screen,
with a versatile set of colors to transform into anything we want to make.

> More stuffs on recommended usage coming soon

Font used in the styles: Proxima Nova family
